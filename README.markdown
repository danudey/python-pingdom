Python API for Twitter
======================

### Description

A simple Python API to interact with Pingdom's web services API. The code
is mostly frameworked out, but a lot of the more complicated things haven't
been finished yet.

### Dependencies

Python-pingdom depends on the SOAPpy module.

### Usage

There's no documentation as yet, since the module's been in flux. You can see
my [initial blog post](http://cdslash.net/2009/08/python-pingdom-accessing-pingdom-from-python/)
about the project for a few examples. The code, hopefully, should be relatively
easy to read.
